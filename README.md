# Salon Appointment Scheduler

## Overview

Welcome to the Salon Appointment Scheduler project! This is a FreeCodeCamp project required to earn your certification. The goal of this project is to create an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to manage customer appointments for a salon.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll build a command-line interface (CLI) application in Bash that allows users to:
- View a list of available services.
